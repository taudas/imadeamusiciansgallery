I made a Musicians Gallery for $6
   with Cloudflare Stream and Cloudflare Pages
</center>
I  was looking for a way to present a set of audio files. Iâ€™ve been learning a lot about serverless, and I thought this type of web app would be perfect for that.

So here is the challenge: Take a set of audio files and present a playable web interface.

I am familiar with Cloudflare Tunnels so I thought I would use Cloudflare Stream for the host. This service consists of two parts - storage and streaming. The storage cost is $5 per kilominute. The streaming cost is $1 per kilominute. So first you establish your content - 1000 minutes of storage for $5/month. Then you enable streaming - 1000 minutes of streaming for $1/month.
I have 717 minutes stored and I used less than 1000 minutes last month - This cost me $6.
