I made a Musicians Gallery for $6
   with Cloudflare Stream and Cloudflare Pages

I  was looking for a way to present a set of audio files. Iâ€™ve been learning a lot about serverless, and I thought this type of web app would be perfect for that.

So here is the challenge: Take a set of audio files and present a playable web interface.

I am familiar with Cloudflare Tunnels so I thought I would use Cloudflare Stream for the host. This service consists of two parts - storage and streaming. The storage cost is $5 per kilominute. The streaming cost is $1 per kilominute. So first you establish your content - 1000 minutes of storage for $5/month. Then you enable streaming - 1000 minutes of streaming for $1/month.
I have 717 minutes stored and I used less than 1000 minutes last month - This cost me $6.

First turn your mp3 into mp4
Then manage all your files
Here is the upload script
And here is the list script
So now i have a list of uuids
Use jquery to construct an html fragment
So now how to publish this? - Cloudflare Pages
One page
First announce your intentions
Then show the default vid
Then insert the html fragment with the links and thumbnails
voila
